## Current Status

The site is deployed and operational. The newsletter is accepting signups via Upstash rate limits and Beehiiv insertion.

The `/pro` page is live at `aithreatbrief.com/pro`. Pro CTAs are present in the header (Go Pro button), footer nav, ToolsMatrix bottom bar, and the Tools page CTA section.

LinkedIn Insight Tag base script is wired in `app/layout.tsx`. Campaign Manager now has Partner ID `9120908`, and the event-specific Pro signup conversion is `25104812`. Both production Vercel env vars are present, the site has been redeployed, and the live domain is loading the tag.

LinkedIn Company Page `AI Security Brief` is now live, and the new Campaign Manager ad account `521990231` has been created with locked settings `AI Security Brief — Main`, `AUD`, and associated Page `AI Security Brief`.

Campaign Manager now also has a saved draft website-conversion ad set:

- Campaign Group ID: `862504326`
- Draft Campaign ID: `622908116`
- Draft name: `AU Pro Signup Document Draft`
- Objective: `WEBSITE_CONVERSION`
- Format: `SPONSORED_UPDATE_NATIVE_DOCUMENT`
- Budget: `A$20/day`
- Geography: `Australia`
- Audience expansion: `Off`
- LAN: `Off`
- Conversion selected: `Pro Signup` (`25104812`)

LinkedIn two-step verification for the profile is confirmed enabled. The `Business information` and payment method flow are complete, ad account `521990231` is `Active`, and the first document-ad creative has been uploaded to the saved draft website-conversion campaign.

## System Notes

Update this file whenever `main` advances. Pin the SHA in the header. External tooling should verify state against this file, not against prior conversation context.

## Remaining Blockers (LinkedIn Campaign Launch)

1. **Beehiiv Pro tier** — Set up paid tier checkout in Beehiiv dashboard so `/pro` CTA has a real destination
2. **Campaign launch decision** — Review draft campaign `622908116`, confirm final targeting/budget copy, and explicitly launch when ready
3. **LinkedIn domain confirmation** — Recheck Campaign Manager until the tracked domain state reflects the live site load, since that status is controlled on LinkedIn’s side
4. **Beehiiv paid routing** — Replace placeholder Pro CTA routing with the final Beehiiv paid checkout destination once configured
5. **Pause legacy campaigns if still spending** — If any older LinkedIn ad account is still active, pause campaigns driving traffic to non-Pro pages
